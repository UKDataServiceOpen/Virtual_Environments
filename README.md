# What is here

This github repo is intended to demonstrate the value of:
* jupyter notebooks,
* collaborative, cloud-based, version control repositories such as [GitHub](github.com),
* browser-based virtual environments such as [binder](mybinder.org), and
* Digital Object Identifier (DOI) created through means such as GitHub and [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/4514864)

as useful tools when making code, data and other research materials easy for others to understand, inspect, cite and develop. 

# Why I created it
This repo and the associated notebooks, materials and more were created to support a presentation at the [UKCOTS conference](https://www.ukcots.org/) held in Manchester, UK on 13-14 June, 2024. 

That presentation was titled **Reproducibile statistics: jupyter notebooks, github and DOI** and the abstract was:
> In school, we are all told to show our work. But as researchers and academics, how often do we really show our work? Well, in the modern age, we can not only show our work but also make it VERY easy for others to understand it, inspect it, cite it, and further develop it! This workshop demonstrates how jupyter notebooks, github (or other version control repositories) and DOI can be used to make your statistics and data work fully reproducible and citeable! 

However, I expect that this repo and its materials will also be useful more generally as small, quick-to-load demonstrations of the component parts. For example, it is quite useful to show people who work in teaching how easy it can be to make virtual environments while those who work collaboratively may want an easy way to see how version control logs show edit history. 

# What you can do with it

Since I built a virtual environment for this repo in binder, all you have to do is push this button! Fill in the fields to see the markdown badge snippet. [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/UKDataServiceOpen/Virtual_Environments/main)

It should launch a virtual environment in a new tab in your browser. This will allow you to open the jupyter notebook (the file that ends in .ipynb) and run the code cells inside it **without needing to install python or jupyter notebook**! How exciting is that?!?

# The data
The data is the [Super Heroes Dataset from kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/claudiodavi/superhero-set?resource=download) and is used under the CC0: Public Domain license.
